Welcome To Liar's Dice! Here Are The Rules!

All players roll their dice.
The first player will then call how many dice of a certain value are on the table.
The number called will be based on the entire dice pool in play including your own dice.
The remaining players must either pass or call if this player's prediction is correct.
If all players pass then the game continues and the next player must call a higher value in total dice of any number.
Players will be rewarded with one point if they correctly call bluff or have someone falsely call their bluff.
If not the game will continue until someone is called out, Have fun!
